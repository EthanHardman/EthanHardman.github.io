            I enjoy producing UK electronic styles, but my favourite thing to mix and master
            is music with real instruments and human feel – where my background on trumpet
            makes it easier to lock into the performance.

                I mix full multi-track sessions for both live and electronic music. Whether it’s
                a band recording, a project full of layered synths or a hybrid of the two, I try

          <h2 class="section-title">Musician first, engineer by choice.</h2>
          <p>
            I’m an audio engineer and music producer based in Greater Manchester, UK. I’ve been
            working with audio since 2019, and I come at everything from a musical angle rather
            than purely technical.
          </p>
          <p>
            I studied BA (Hons) Music at the University of Leeds and BTEC Music Technology, and
            I’ve been playing trumpet since 2011. That performance background really shapes how I
            hear things – especially live instrumentation and arrangements where phrasing and dynamics
            matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do enjoy producing UK-based electronic genres, but when I’m mixing and mastering
            I’m particularly drawn to music with real instruments and human feel. Brass, bands,
            acoustic recordings – that’s where my ear feels most at home.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Worked with audio and production since 2019.</li>
            <li>Comfortable across live, acoustic and electronic projects.</li>
            <li>Mix decisions always tied back to musical feel and intention.</li>
